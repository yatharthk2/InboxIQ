Problem Statement: Unified Email Productivity Hub

The objective is to develop a centralized email management platform that streamlines communication, enhances productivity, and reduces procrastination by leveraging natural language processing and agentic automation. This hub will consolidate multiple email accounts, integrate with productivity tools, and provide intelligent workflows to manage emails efficiently. The platform will support diverse use cases, including job applications, sales, education, and daily communications, while incorporating contextual document/image handling and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive, Google Meet, and Google Calendar.

Key Features and Use Cases

1. Natural Language Email Handling

Users can compose and send emails using conversational commands, eliminating the complexity of formal email drafting. For example:





Use Case: A user wants to apply for a software engineering role. They can say, "Hey assistant, send a cold email from yatharth.k2@gmail.com to Vignesh@amazon.com expressing interest in the SWE role, referencing my resume." The system extracts relevant details from the provided resume and crafts a professional email.



Contextual Support: The platform supports attaching or referencing documents (e.g., resumes, images) to provide context, ensuring personalized and relevant communication.

2. Automated Workflows and Follow-Ups

The platform enables users to set up routines and workflows for email threads to automate repetitive tasks, such as follow-ups or meeting scheduling.





Use Case: A user can command, "Create a follow-up routine for the cold email to Vignesh, sending up to 5 follow-ups every week." The system tracks responses and sends timely reminders or follow-up emails, reducing manual effort.



Workflow Examples:





Schedule follow-ups based on user-defined intervals.



Trigger actions like meeting setup upon receiving specific responses.

3. Intelligent Monitoring and Proactive Notifications

The platform monitors incoming emails, identifies action-required messages, and prompts users with context-aware suggestions.





Use Case: The system detects a meeting request from Vignesh and notifies the user: "Hey Yatharth, Vignesh is awaiting your response to schedule a meeting. Your calendar is free on Monday at 10 AM. Should I confirm the meeting or suggest another time?" The user can respond naturally, and the system handles the email response.



Proactivity: By integrating with Google Calendar, the platform checks availability and proposes suitable meeting times, minimizing scheduling friction.

4. Unified Email Management with Tagging

The platform consolidates all email accounts (e.g., personal, business, job-related) under one interface, allowing users to manage communications by assigning tags like [Personal], [Business], or [Job].





Use Case: A user can say, "Show me all [Job] emails" or "Send a [Business] email to a client." The system filters or routes emails based on tags, simplifying multi-account management.



Tag-Based Commands: Users can issue commands like, "Reply to all [Personal] emails with a holiday greeting," streamlining bulk actions.

5. Agentic Integrations for Enhanced Productivity

The platform integrates with external tools to perform agentic actions, such as file sharing, meeting scheduling, or calendar management, directly through email commands.





Use Case: A user can say, "Share the latest project report from Google Drive with Vignesh via email and schedule a Google Meet for Sunday." The system retrieves the file, attaches it to the email, and creates a Google Meet link, syncing the event to Google Calendar.



Supported Integrations:





Google Drive: Attach or reference files in emails.



Google Meet: Generate meeting links and send invitations.



Google Calendar: Check availability and schedule events.



Other potential integrations include CRM tools, task managers, or educational platforms.

Benefits





Reduced Procrastination: Natural language commands and automated workflows simplify email tasks, encouraging timely action.



Increased Efficiency: Unified management, intelligent notifications, and integrations streamline communication across personal and professional contexts.



Scalability: The platform supports diverse use cases, from job applications to sales outreach and daily communications, making it adaptable to various industries.



Context-Aware Automation: By leveraging document/image context and calendar availability, the system ensures relevant and actionable outputs.
